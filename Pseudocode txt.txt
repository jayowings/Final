    player input string of values (separated by a comma for ease of access, no spaces)
    check values
        per value == add to a count, remove value from player array **create temp computer array for next check without values that are exact matches
        then, if remaining player values in computer array, add to a seperate count
    display checks
if player
until all five are correct or no turns remain
    computer displays array[5] (first iteration all values are random)
    player inputs correct and "in but not correct" values
    computer saves # values, randomizing the rest (# based loosely on num correct and in)
    if all 5 were correct, computer wins
