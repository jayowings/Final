Codebreaker game
input if computer or player makes the code
if computer
create an array[5] with five set values
until all five are guessed correctls or no turns remain
    player input string of values (separated by a comma for ease of access, no spaces)
    check values
        per value in the right place in the code, add to a count, remove value from player array **create temp computer array for next check without values that are exact matches
        then, if remaining player values exist in computer array, add to a seperate count
    display checks
if player
until all five are correct or no turns remain
    computer displays array[5] (first iteration all values are random)
    player inputs correct and "in the code but not in the correct place" values
    computer saves # of values, randomizing the rest (# based loosely on num correct and in)
    if all 5 were correct, computer wins

computer turn logic
*flags
if(prevCorrect == Correct and change == 1){
    set to FALSE
    if Almost == 0 and no nonTRUE duplicates, set all to FALSE for changed value
}
if(prevCorrect <> Correct){
    *****only one TRUE value can exist per previousGuesses[8] array (value checker) (for the few times two values are changed)
    set correct value to TRUE
    set other value to FALSE (if Almost == 0 and no nonTRUE duplicates set all to FALSE for changed value)
    call back TRUE value
}


*manipulation
save correct as prevCorrect
for(value in code == true){ "Known corrcet"
    Correct-- (ignore values known as TRUE)
}

if(Correct > 0){
    add new value in [4] (or 1 less than previous change if num values changed == 1) (skipping TRUE values)
    unless [] of previous changes == Correct (+1 for all value == TRUE of lower index), then mark TRUE and recount Correct (should be 0)
}

if(Almost > 0 and Correct == 0){
    set all values to FALSE
    shift all values left one (skipping over true values), add new value in [4]
    repeat shift for values that are FALSE in given location ([0] is stored at [4])
    count shifts, if >= 5, new(UNKNOWN) value for all FALSE
}else if(Correct == 0 and Almost == 0){
    flag all values as FALSE in all positions (ignoring any values marked TRUE)
    New(UNKNOWN) value for all FALSE
}

save guess (in a linked list?) in previous guess value (initialized as [0,0,0,0,0]) along with prevCorrect and prevAlmost










2 Classes
    class Code
    
Variable
    string choice;
Struct or Enum
    enum INCODE{} stuct code{}
Array
    int computerCode[5];
Function
    void Pguess();
Control structure (for loop, while loop, if statement, or switch statement)
    Whole Game Console is while and ifs
